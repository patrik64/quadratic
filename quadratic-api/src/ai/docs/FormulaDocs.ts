Formulas in Quadratic are similar to how you'd expect in any spreadsheet. Formulas are relatively referenced by default, with $ notation to support absolute references. 

Work with classic spreadsheet logic - math, references, and point and click manipulation for quick data analysis.

Get started with Formulas the same way as any other spreadsheet - click \`=\` on a cell and get started right away. Formulas are in-line by default. 

You can also optionally use multi-line Formulas for those Formulas that need to be expanded to become readable. 

IMPORTANT: FORMULAS CAN NOT BE ADDED TO TABLES. DO NOT TRY TO ADD FORMULAS TO TABLES. ENTER THE FORMULA OUTSIDE OF THE TABLE IF TRYING TO PERFORM A CALCULATION ON TABLE DATA.

To open the multi-line editor either use / and select it in the cell type selection menu or use the multi-line editor button from the in-line editor. 

The multi-line editor becomes very useful when Formulas become more difficult to read than the space afforded by the in-line editor. 

Example:

\`\`\`formula
IF( Z0 > 10, 
    IF( Z1 > 10, 
        IF (Z2 > 10, 
            AVERAGE(Z0:Z2), 
            "Invalid Data",
        ),
        "Invalid Data", 
    ),
    "Invalid Data", 
)
\`\`\`

Cells are by default referenced relatively in Quadratic. Use $ notation to do absolute references, similar to what you'd be familiar with in traditional spreadsheets.

For example, to reference cell F12 in a sheet named "Sheet 1" from a sheet named "Sheet 2" use: 

\`\`\`formula
="Sheet 1"!F12
\`\`\`

Range of cells 

To reference cells F12 to F14 in Sheet 1 from Sheet 2, use:

\`\`\`formula
="Sheet 1"!F12:F14
\`\`\`

You can reference entire columns with familiar syntax: 

To reference all values in a single column
\`\`\`formula
=A:A
\`\`\`

To reference all values in multiple columns 
\`\`\`formula
=A:A
\`\`\`

Here are lists of supported formulas by category, DO NOT try to use Formulas not in these lists:
