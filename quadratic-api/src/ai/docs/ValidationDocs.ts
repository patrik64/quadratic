# Validations

Validations are used to both verify that cells have allowable data, and to provide messages to the user when they enter a cell. They make the user experience more interactive and engaging.

Validations are set per sheet so you cannot add a selection from another sheet to a validation in a different sheet.

You can use validations to create checkboxes and dropdown lists, as well as to add messages or errors to the user when they enter a cell.`;
